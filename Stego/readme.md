# Steganography
This will mostly be going over some basic stego, as well as a few things that are common in most CTFs.


**Note:** The PDF version does differ from the actual slides. This is due to the GIFs, which aren't supported on PDFs. The PDF has also been edited so it makes sense when reading it by itself, as some slides were purely visual and reliant on explanations.
